I will continue with the discrete named distributions including:

* the curiously named "negative binomial", which is in the Bernoulli process family
* the also curiously named "hypergeometric", which is not really in the Bernoulli process family, but I'll introduce it now anyway.
* a quick note not mentioned in the book about how we can consider constants to be "random variables" too, as a convenience.
* start talking about the very important Poisson distributions, which are sort of in the Bernoulli process family.

Reminder: the PDF notes are not reliable. Use them only in class if you want. I will start removing them after class. The proper way to view notes after the fact is to get the files onto your computer and open the HTML file in a browser. I will add some commentary on the course website about this.
